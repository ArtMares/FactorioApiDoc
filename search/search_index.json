Login Endpoint # To log in, a HTTP POST request has to be sent to /api-login . The following parameters have to be sent in application/x-www-form-urlencoded form: username , Type: String The name of the user to be logged in. Instead of the name, the e-mail can also be used. However, note that this is actually the only place where the e-mail is a valid replacement for the name. password , Type: String The users password. In addition, the following parameters are optional: require_game_ownership , Type: Boolean The default value when not specified is False . If True is specified, the request will only succeed if the user has bought a Factorio license (required to download mods). api_version , Type: Integer The version of the API to use. At the time of writing this the most recent version is 2 , which is also the default value when not specified. As an example, a complete request string could look like this: username=FactorioPlayer&password=SuperSecretPassword&require_game_ownership=true&api_version=2 If the credentials were invalid or require_game_ownership=true is specified and the account does not own a Factorio license, a code 401 is returned.
